# CS350-Emerging-Sys-Arch-Tech

# Summerize
I have posted two projects, both involve GPIO interrupt. Both I feel I executed almost perfectly, one project labeled Module 5 Milestone shows the ability to create morse code in which the program will have the LED lights of the microcontroller board to blick SOS and then when the program ends it gives time for the user to hit the toggle button to switch to the work 'OK.' With the second project labeled Final_Project in which I had to create a thermostat in which I had to set the temperature a fixed temperature and that anytime that the fixed temerapture were to go above or below they light on the LED would light up indicating that the set temperature has gone out of the parameters that it was set at. In which the user will then have to hit the raise heat or lower heat button and when the temperature reaches the desired temerature the LED light would turn off. We use different drivers of the microcontroller that being GPIO, Power, UART, I2C, and timer functionality.

# What did you do particularly well?
I feel that I executed the user input very well, for when they hit the toggle buttons to get the desired solution the user wants the toggle button and the raising and lower of the heat runs to perfection. At least I think it does.

# Where could you improve
I think the structuring of the code could have some better upkeep and more of an orginized fashion. Getting a better understanding so I could improve my skills in embedded programming.

# What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I would want to use IoT (Internet of Things) so I can be able to connect multiple devices to each other to help the user experience and make it more intuitive.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Well having experience in C and C++ will always help in the future as C/C++ developers are in high demand. The use of creating switch statements and calling those statements and functions will help a great deal and it has helped gain great knowledge of how to structure and execute code more effeciently. 

#How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
One can maintain the app with ease and it will help make the code more reliable. It is more readable as I left comments for all the functions and processes that code is executing as it goes through the steps. It is adaptable as if a new developer were maintaining the program with ease as everything is commented out well and understandable of what everything is trying to accomplish.
